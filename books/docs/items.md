# Customize Columns

When the **Customize Columns** feature is enabled in system settings, a **Customize Columns** button appears in each list view. Clicking this button opens the **Column Selector Modal**, which allows users to choose which columns are shown in the list. The modal provides a simple and interactive way to personalize data views through checkboxes and drag-and-drop actions.

Inside the modal, users see two sections: **Displayed Fields** and **Available Fields**. Displayed Fields show the columns that are currently visible in the list view, while Available Fields contain other fields that can be added. Users can easily reorder displayed columns by dragging them, remove columns by unchecking them or dragging them out, and add new columns by checking or dragging them from the Available Fields section. Required fields are protected from being removed, and hidden or table-type fields are excluded automatically. Once the desired columns are selected and arranged, clicking the **Save** button applies the changes and updates the list view accordingly.
