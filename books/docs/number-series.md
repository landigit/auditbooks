# Number Series

Number Series is used as the naming scheme for [transactional entries](transactional-entries.md). Multiple transactions of a single type for example Journal Entry can be grouped under a single Number Series.

Default Number Series
---------------------

By default Auditbooks comes with a single Number Series for each of the transactional entry types

| Type | Number Series |
| --- | --- |
| Sales Invoice | SINV- |
| Purchase Invoice | PINV- |
| Payment | PAY- |
| Journal Entry | JE- |

These are selected by default when making a transactional entry. You can create new a Number Series to suit your needs.

Once you are done editing, click on Save, now you can use the new Number Series for the entry.

Number Series Fields
--------------------

The fields decide how the Number Series is set

1. Prefix: The base prefix applied to the number series for example: *SINV-*
2. Reference Type: The transactional entry type to which this Number Series belongs.
3. Start: The number given to the first entry in the Number Series.
4. Pad Zeros: The number of given as padding to the number part of the Number Series.

For example, if Name is *SALES-PAY-*, Start is 0, and Pad Zeros is 3, then the Number Series values assigned to the transactional entries would be:

*SALES-PAY-000*, *SALES-PAY-001*, *SALES-PAY-002*, *SALES-PAY-003*, etc.
