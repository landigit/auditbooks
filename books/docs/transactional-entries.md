The Close POS Shift feature is used to end a POS shift by recording final cash counts, calculating payment totals, and reconciling amounts.

2. Closing Amounts

* It displays a read-only table showing the Payment Method, Opening Amount, Expected Amount, Closing Amount, and Difference Amount for each payment type.

* This section is used for reconciliation, helping identify any cash shortages or surpluses by comparing the Closing Amount (entered for Cash; zero for non-cash) against the Expected Amount.


The **Submit** button validates all closing amounts, sets the Closing Date, and links the record to the Opening Shift.
